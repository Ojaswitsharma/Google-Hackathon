1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,857
Mark's world crumbled; a failing grade stared back from his history exam

2
00:00:03,857 --> 00:00:07,714
Shame burned, but not as fiercely as his determination

3
00:00:07,714 --> 00:00:11,571
He devoured textbooks, sought extra help, and practiced relentlessly

4
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:15,428
The next exam loomed, a challenge he'd conquer

5
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:19,285
He walked out, a triumphant grin replacing the earlier despair

6
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:23,142
A perfect score

7
00:00:23,142 --> 00:00:27,000
He'd proven failure was merely a steppingÂ stone
