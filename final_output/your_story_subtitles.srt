1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Mark's world crumbled; a failing grade stared back from his history exam.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Shame burned, but not as fiercely as his determination.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
He devoured textbooks, sought extra help, and practiced relentlessly.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The next exam loomed, a challenge he'd conquer.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He walked out, a triumphant grin replacing the earlier despair.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A perfect score.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
He'd proven failure was merely a steppingÂ stone.
